During this dev period we successfully completed two todos from last meeting:
1. Make the model smaller
2. Change loss function from MSE to cross-entropy

Code changes refer to [github](https://github.com/Drenight/BigMelonWithCNN)

The remaining todos will be 
1. Keep inspecting the source code and extract and dump the terminal log output from game into our traning procedure
2. Negative samples feature add-in
